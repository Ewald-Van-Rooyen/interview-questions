Given a sorted array of numbers, remove all duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Extras:
Space complexity O(1)

Example:

Array = [1,1,2]
Fixed Array = [1,2]
New Size = 2

Example:

Array = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Fixed Array = [0,1,2,3,4]
Output = 5
